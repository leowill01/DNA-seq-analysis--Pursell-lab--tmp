# DNA-seq Analysis @ Pursell Lab

This repo is a temporary public repo for analyzing DNA-seq data in the Pursell Lab at Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans, LA.

This repo is noted as temporary because its origin repo needs to be split into separate, project-based repos with these analysis scripts as either a subtree or submodule.
